                Timer-s offers the choices of keeping your counters open or hidden, of deactivating or
                deleting them once you are satisfied. As a user-oriented platform, a user's counters and details
                are accessible only by himself.

                <div class= "ss_about_block ss_left">
                Never lose details about your counter runs or cumulative values! Run counters up to 
                10,000 hours and beyond. No biggie.
